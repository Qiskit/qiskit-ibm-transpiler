Other notes
-----------

- Refactored type definitions by centralizing `OptimizationOptions` in `qiskit_ibm_transpiler/types.py`.

  **What changed?**
  - Introduced `qiskit_ibm_transpiler/types.py` to store shared type definitions.
  - Moved the `OptimizationOptions` type alias to `types.py`, eliminating redundancy.
  - Updated all relevant imports to use the centralized definition.
  - Ensured compliance with **PEP 484** recommendations for type aliasing.

  **How does this affect users?**
  - No breaking changes; this is an internal refactor.
  - Any direct references to `OptimizationOptions` in multiple files now import it from `types.py`.

  **Updated import path:**
  .. code:: python

      from qiskit_ibm_transpiler.types import OptimizationOptions

  This improves code maintainability and makes future type updates easier.

  Fixes `#166 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/issues/166>`. (`166 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/166>`__)
