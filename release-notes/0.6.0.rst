0.6.0 (2024-09-16)
==================

New features
------------

- Add `optimization_preferences` optional input to :class:`.TranspilerService` constructor. 

  With this new feature, users could specify by which properties they want to optimize on the transpiler process. Allowed options are: "n_cnots", "n_gates", "cnot_layers", "layers", "noise", and these options can be provided in two ways:
  - Only an option, as a string value: Transpilation will be done priorizating this element and then the rest of the options
  - Several options, as a list: Transpilation will be done only with the specified elements (`67 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/67>`__)
- Enabling `coupling_map` as options to the AI Synthesis passes (`70 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/70>`__)

- Fixing the type of ECR gates when loading circuits from the qiskit transpiler service (`63 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/63>`__)
