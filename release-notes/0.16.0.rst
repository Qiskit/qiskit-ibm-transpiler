===================

New features
------------

- Added local AI synthesis support using `qiskit-gym` reinforcement learning models. This enables
  local execution of AI-powered Clifford, Linear Function, and Permutation synthesis passes
  using the new open source framework `qiskit-gym`. Models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace
  and cached locally. Configuration is available via environment variables
  (``QISKIT_TRANSPILER_<MODEL_TYPE>_REPO_ID``, ``_REVISION``, ``_SUBDIR``). (`209 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/209>`__)
