The ``qiskit-ibm-ai-local-transpiler`` package is now installed by default as a required dependency. Previously, this was an optional dependency that users needed to install explicitly using ``pip install qiskit-ibm-transpiler[ai-local-mode]``. The ``[ai-local-mode]`` extra is maintained for backward compatibility but is no longer necessary. This change improves the default user experience by enabling AI transpiler passes to run locally without additional installation steps.
