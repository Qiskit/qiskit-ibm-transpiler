Refactored type definitions by centralizing `OptimizationOptions` in `qiskit_ibm_transpiler/types.py`.

**What changed?**
- Introduced `qiskit_ibm_transpiler/types.py` to store shared type definitions.
- Moved the `OptimizationOptions` type alias to `types.py`, eliminating redundancy.
- Updated all relevant imports to use the centralized definition.
- Ensured compliance with **PEP 484** recommendations for type aliasing.

**How does this affect users?**
- No breaking changes; this is an internal refactor.
- Any direct references to `OptimizationOptions` in multiple files now import it from `types.py`.

**Updated import path:**
.. code:: python

    from qiskit_ibm_transpiler.types import OptimizationOptions

This improves code maintainability and makes future type updates easier.

Fixes `#166 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/issues/166>`.
