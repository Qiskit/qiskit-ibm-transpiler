Migrated project environment management from `pip` (`requirements-dev.txt`) and `setup.py` to the `uv` tool. In addition, the files `ruff.toml` and `pytest.ini` files have been merged on the `pyproject.toml` file.

**What changed**
- Introduced `uv` for dependency resolution and virtual environment management.
- Replaced `requirements-dev.txt` with dependency groups defined in `pyproject.toml`.
- Updated the development workflow (`.github/actions` and `.github/workflows`) and contribution guidelines to use `uv sync` and `uv run`.
- Added documentation on using extras (e.g., `--extra ai-local-mode`), group selections (e.g., `uv sync --group dev|docs`) and Python version selection.

**Impact to users**
- No functional changes to the library itself.
- Contributors now manage environments using `uv` instead of `pip`.
