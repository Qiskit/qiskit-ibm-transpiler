0.15.0 (2025-12-02)
===================

Upgrade notes
-------------

- Dropped support for Python 3.9, which has reached end-of-life. The minimum supported Python version is now **3.10**. Users running Python 3.9 must upgrade to Python 3.10 or 3.11 to use this version of ``qiskit-ibm-transpiler`` and later. (`227 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/227>`__)
- Update old compatible syntaxis with 3.9 like `List[Union[DAGOpNode, DAGDepNode]]:` , to modern one: `list[DAGOpNode | DAGDepNode]`. (`230 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/230>`__)
- The ``qiskit-ibm-ai-local-transpiler`` package is now installed by default as a required dependency. Previously, this was an optional dependency that users needed to install explicitly using ``pip install qiskit-ibm-transpiler[ai-local-mode]``. The ``[ai-local-mode]`` extra is maintained for backward compatibility but is no longer necessary. This change improves the default user experience by enabling AI transpiler passes to run locally without additional installation steps. (`231 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/231>`__)


New features
------------

- Added support for Python 3.12 and 3.13. The library now supports Python versions
  **3.10 through 3.13**. (`228 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/228>`__)


Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed GitHub Actions CD workflow error by replacing the invalid ``python-version`` parameter in the ``astral-sh/setup-uv@v3`` action with a separate step using ``uv python install 3.11`` to properly install Python 3.11. (`226 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/226>`__)


Other notes
-----------

- Removed the obsolete ``requirements-dev.txt`` file that was replaced by dependency groups in ``pyproject.toml`` in version 0.14.5. (`225 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/pull/225>`__)
